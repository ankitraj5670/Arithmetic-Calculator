# Arithmetic calcutor

This is a replication of arithmetic calcultor program written in C. It provides arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, exponential calculations, and logarithmic functions. The program runs in a console environment and offers a menu-driven interface for easy navigation.

## Features

- **Calculation**: Perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Trigonometry**: Compute trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, tangent, hyperbolic sine, hyperbolic cosine, hyperbolic tangent, arcsine, arccosine, and arctangent.
- **Exponential**: Calculate the exponential of a given number raised to a specified power.
- **Logarithm**: Compute logarithms of numbers with base-e or base-10.

## Instructions

1. Run the program in a C-compatible compiler environment.
2. Upon execution, the program presents a menu with various options.
3. Choose an option by entering the corresponding number.
4. Follow the prompts to input necessary values for the chosen operation.
5. View the result and continue with additional calculations or return to the main menu.
6. To exit the program, select the "Exit" option from the main menu.

## Note

- Ensure that the input values are appropriate for the selected operations to avoid unexpected results or errors.
- Be cautious with division operations to avoid division by zero errors.
